I'm a full-stack software engineer, experienced in React.js and Ruby on Rails, with a background in dentistry.

As a former dental student who has worked in numerous private practices and a start-up, I forged critical values in work ethic, adaptability, and team-building. I am driven by the prospect of not only diversifying tech, but by using tech for the greater good.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy going on long runs, flying my drone, and exploring new places with my dog, Koda.
