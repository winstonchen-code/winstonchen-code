I'm an Application Engineer with a demonstrated history of working for a SaaS in an enterprise environment and a high growth startup. Skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. Experience with Jira, Confluence, and DataDog. I am always looking for innovative and unique approaches to both technical and design problems.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy going on long runs, flying my drone, and exploring new places with my dog, Koda.
