I'm a Technical Support Engineer with a demonstrated history of working for a SaaS in an enterprise environment and a high growth startup. Skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, React, and Ruby on Rails. Experience with Jira, Confluence, and DataDog. I am always looking for innovative and unique approaches to both technical and design problems.

In my free time, I enjoy going on long runs, flying my drone, and exploring new places with my dog, Koda.
