### Hi there! 👋

My name is **Winston Chen** and I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer, experienced in JavaScript, React, and Ruby on Rails with a background in dentistry. I am always looking for innovative and unique approaches to both technical and design problems.

As a former dental student 🦷 who has worked in private practices and a start-up, I forged critical values in work ethic, adaptability, and team-building. I am driven by the prospect of not only diversifying tech, but by using tech for the greater good.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy going on long runs, flying my drone, and exploring new places with my 🐶, Koda.
